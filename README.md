# BROqoli
BROqoli is an iOS app and website designed to show the amount of currency that you own on different cryptocurrency wallets as well as the equivalent in USD or EURO.
BROqoli is different from the other wallets because all the information is in a single interface and you don't need to include your private or public key, simply the amount of crypto owned.   
This app was made in 2017, and hasn't been changed since.

## Usage
As of May 2019, the website and the app are no longer supported.
